      <div className="w-5/6">
        Welcome to Weather-App - a project built by a student developer to learn
        React!
              <br />
              <br />
        <div>
          This Weather App is a one-person project, made by a developer who's
          eager to level up their React skills. It's a simple and
          straightforward app that gives you the current weather details. I made
          it with a minimalistic design to keep things neat and tidy.
        </div>
        <div></div>
        <br /> Why did I make this?
        <br />
        <div>
          Well, I wanted to get hands-on experience with React and learn how to
          fetch data from APIs. So, I thought, why not build something fun and
          practical at the same time?
        </div>
        <br />
        <ul className="list-disc flex flex-col gap-4 pt-4 text-black ">
          Here's what you can expect from Weather-App:

            Weather-App uses APIs to fetch up-to-date weather information. So,

          <li>
            <span className="text-blue-900 font-bold mr-1">

            The user interface is kept clean and simple. No distractions or
            fancy stuff, just the weather you need.

            said, this is a learning project for me. I'm constantly tweaking and
            improving it as I learn new things. Feel free to follow along with
            my progress!

            The code is open source, so if you're learning React too, you can
            take a peek and use it as a reference for your own projects.

        it. Your feedback is essential to help me grow, so drop me a line if you

        spirit of continuous learning.Thanks for checking out my little project.
