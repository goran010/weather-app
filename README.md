# Weather App (In Development)

![Weather App Screenshot](./appScreenshot.png)

## Introduction

The Weather App is an ongoing web application project that aims to provide users with the ability to check the current weather conditions and 5-day forecasts for a specific city. The app fetches weather data from the "Open Meteo" API to provide accurate and up-to-date information. Users can also view a map showing the location of the selected city.

## Features

- **City Weather**: Users can input a city name in the search bar and view the current weather conditions for that city. The app will also display a 5-day forecast with detailed weather information for each day.

- **Weather Icons**: The app integrates a weather icon library to represent the weather conditions visually. Users can see appropriate weather icons, such as a sun for sunny days, a cloud for cloudy days, etc., for each day's forecast.

- **Geolocation**: The app automatically detects the user's current location and displays the weather for that location by default. Users can also manually input a different city to view its weather.

- **Map View**: The app provides a map view that shows the location of the selected city. This feature helps users visualize the geographical location of the city they are interested in.

- **About Page**: The app includes an About page that provides information about the project, its purpose, and the technologies used.

## Technologies Used

The Weather App is built using the following technologies:

- React A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Router: A library for handling routing in the React application.
- Redux: A state management library for managing application state.
- TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for creating responsive and customizable designs.
- Open Meteo API: An external API used to fetch weather data.

## Learning Opportunities

By building this Weather App, you will have an opportunity to learn and gain experience in the following:

- React: Understand the fundamentals of React and how to create components and manage state in a React application.

- React Router: Learn how to handle routing and navigation within a React app, allowing users to navigate between different pages.

- Redux: Get hands-on experience with state management using Redux, allowing for a more organized and scalable application.

- TypeScript: Gain familiarity with TypeScript, its benefits, and how to use static typing for more robust code.

- Tailwind CSS: Explore Tailwind CSS and its utility classes to create responsive and visually appealing designs with ease.

- Integrating External APIs: Learn how to fetch data from external APIs and integrate it into your application.
